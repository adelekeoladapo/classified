                            <p>
                                Using HomeBuds is generally free, but we sometimes charge a fee for certain premium services. If the service you use incurs a fee, you'll be able to review and accept terms that will be clearly disclosed at the time you post your ad. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our fees are quoted in Nigerian Naira (NGN), and we may change them from time to time. We'll notify you of changes to our fee policy by posting such changes on the HomeBuds website. We may choose to temporarily change our fees for promotional events or new services; these changes are effective when we announce the promotional event or new service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You are responsible for paying the HomeBuds fees when they're due. If you don't, without prejudice to any other right or remedy we may be entitled to under these Terms of Use or by law, we may limit your ability to use the premium services. 
                            </p
                            <p>
                                You acknowledge that your ads may be deleted from the HomeBuds sites, services, applications or tools in case we believe these Terms of Use, including our Posting Rules, are breached, either directly or indirectly. In case you would have paid a fee for the display of such ad, you may be entitled to a refund of such fee. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, we reserve the right not to refund the HomeBuds users for any fees paid through use of our sites, services, applications and tools in the following cases:
                            </p>
                            <br/>

                                    If your ads went live with exposure on the HomeBuds sites, services, applications or tools, even for a limited time, and that they benefited from the service associated with the paid fee;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If your ads are placed in Newsletters, promotion emails and main-page pane categories of HomeBuds;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you have removed your ads yourself;

                                <li>
                                    If you post duplicate ads as defined in our rules regarding duplicate ads;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If we believe that your ads are in a significantly wrong category;
